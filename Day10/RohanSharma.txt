My name is Rohan Sharma, and I was born and raised in the heart of Dehradun, a city cradled in the Himalayan foothills. The lush green landscapes, the crisp mountain air, and the serene backdrop of the Mussoorie hills were the companions of my childhood. I spent my school years exploring the hidden trails of the Forest Research Institute and cycling through the quiet, leafy lanes of our neighborhood. Those years instilled in me a deep appreciation for nature and a calm demeanor that has carried through to my university life. The grounding I received from my hometown, with its blend of natural beauty and academic legacy, has shaped me into who I am today.
Choosing to attend the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) felt like a natural progression, as it allowed me to stay connected to my roots while pursuing an education that was both ambitious and forward-looking. I am currently in my second year of the B.Tech. in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The vibrant, tech-focused environment at UPES has been a fantastic platform for me to transform my passion for technology into practical skills. Iâ€™ve found that the curriculum constantly evolves to keep pace with industry demands, preventing an outdated education.
My time at UPES has been a blend of academic rigor and extracurricular engagement. I am an active member of the university's Coding Club and have participated in several hackathons, including the university's own UHackathon. These experiences have taught me the importance of teamwork and innovative problem-solving under pressure. Balancing demanding projects with my coursework has helped me become more organized and resilient.
Beyond the classroom, I enjoy unwinding on the beautiful campus, which is surrounded by the hills I grew up watching. Whether it's a casual game of football with friends or simply taking a walk to clear my head, the tranquil environment offers a perfect escape from academic stress. The campus has a strong senior-junior relationship, making it a friendly and welcoming community.
Ultimately, my goal is to leverage my skills in AI and ML to contribute to meaningful technological innovations.
